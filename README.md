# Financial Engineering

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive suite of financial engineering tools that integrate various sophisticated methodologies for asset pricing, portfolio optimization, option pricing, and technical analysis. This suite will serve as a robust framework for financial analysts, portfolio managers, and individual investors to make informed investment decisions.

## Technical Analysis
Technical Analysis is an essential tool for traders and investors, offering a systematic approach to understanding market trends and predicting price movements. By examining historical data, we aim to make informed decisions regarding the future performance of selected assets. The data for this analysis is sourced from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from January 1, 2018, to January 22, 2024.

## Markowitz Portfolio Optimizer
The primary goal is to construct an optimal investment portfolio using the principles of Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory. By applying mean-variance optimization, we aim to find the perfect balance between risk and return. This analysis will provide valuable insights for investors seeking to maximize portfolio performance.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a widely used financial framework that helps determine the expected return on an investment based on its risk. This model plays a crucial role in portfolio management and asset pricing, providing a foundation for understanding the relationship between risk and return. The chosen assets for this analysis are:

- NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) 
- Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)
- International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)
- Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)
- Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)
- BlackRock Inc. (BLK)
- JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)
- Visa Inc. (V)
- The Walt Disney Company (DIS)
- Netflix Inc. (NFLX)

## Option Pricing Module
This project delves into the intricacies of option pricing by employing both the Binomial and Black-Scholes models. We will explore the pricing dynamics of options, focusing on a comprehensive analysis of call and put options. The data used for this analysis is sourced from Yahoo Finance.
